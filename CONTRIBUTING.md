### Adding New Services

When adding a new service to Surge:

1. **Research the service**:
   - Official Docker image availability
   - Resource requirements
   - Configuration complexity
   - Integration capabilities

2. **Update Docker Compose**:
   - Add service definition
   - Include proper volumes and networks
   - Set appropriate profiles
   - Add health checks if available

3. **Update configuration**:
   - Add to `.env.example`
   - Update homepage configuration
   - Add service-specific config templates

4. **Update documentation**:
   - Add to README service list
   - Update quick start guide
   - Add troubleshooting section

5. **Test thoroughly**:
   - Fresh deployment
   - Service integration
   - Update process
   - Backup/restore

### Updating Existing Services

1. **Test with current configuration**
2. **Check for breaking changes**
3. **Update documentation** if needed
4. **Test migration path** for existing users

### Security Considerations
