# Remaining Issues Fix Summary
# ============================

echo "🔍 REMAINING DEPLOYMENT ISSUES ANALYSIS"
echo "========================================"
echo ""

echo "✅ GREAT SUCCESS FROM OUR PREVIOUS FIXES:"
echo "=========================================="
echo "• API Key Discovery: ALL 5 SERVICES FOUND SUCCESSFULLY! 🎉"
echo "  ✅ Radarr API: 083fd2ad..."
echo "  ✅ Sonarr API: c50489cd..."
echo "  ✅ Prowlarr API: f3c262f2..."
echo "  ✅ Bazarr API: 955bc26c..."
echo "  ✅ Tautulli API: ec94204d..."
echo ""
echo "• Prowlarr Applications: COMPLETELY FIXED! 🎉"
echo "  ✅ Radarr application configured successfully"
echo "  ✅ Sonarr application configured successfully"
echo ""

echo "❌ REMAINING ISSUES TO RESOLVE:"
echo "==============================="
echo ""

echo "1. 🔐 PERMISSION ISSUES"
echo "   Problem: Interactive sudo prompts during media directory creation"
echo "   Impact: Deployment hangs waiting for password input"
echo "   Status: FIXED - Updated permission handling to avoid interactive sudo"
echo ""

echo "2. 🎬 PLEX LIBRARY CREATION"
echo "   Problem: Cannot create libraries without authentication token"
echo "   Impact: Manual Plex setup required"
echo "   Solution: Plex libraries need to be created manually after initial setup"
echo "   Workaround: Access Plex at http://localhost:32400 to complete setup"
echo ""

echo "3. 🔗 SERVICE INTERCONNECTION HTTP ERRORS"
echo "   Problem: HTTP 405/400 errors in service connections"
echo "   Examples:"
echo "     • Bazarr ↔ Radarr: 405 (Method Not Allowed)"
echo "     • Bazarr ↔ Sonarr: 405 (Method Not Allowed)"
echo "     • NZBGet ↔ Radarr: 400 (Bad Request)"
echo "     • NZBGet ↔ Sonarr: 400 (Bad Request)"
echo "   Impact: Some automated connections may not be established"
echo ""

echo "4. 📡 RDT-CLIENT SERVICE STARTUP"
echo "   Problem: RDT-Client not responding after 5 minutes"
echo "   Impact: Real-Debrid download automation not available immediately"
echo "   Likely Cause: Service taking longer to initialize or configuration issue"
echo ""

echo "🎯 PRIORITY ASSESSMENT:"
echo "======================="
echo "🟢 HIGH PRIORITY (Core functionality working):"
echo "   • Prowlarr ↔ Radarr/Sonarr communication: WORKING ✅"
echo "   • API key discovery: WORKING ✅"
echo "   • Service startup: WORKING ✅"
echo ""
echo "🟡 MEDIUM PRIORITY (Enhancement issues):"
echo "   • Service interconnections (some failing but non-critical)"
echo "   • Plex library automation (manual setup alternative available)"
echo ""
echo "🔴 LOW PRIORITY (Optional services):"
echo "   • RDT-Client startup (can be configured later)"
echo ""

echo "📋 RECOMMENDED ACTIONS:"
echo "======================="
echo "1. ✅ Permission fix applied - test deployment"
echo "2. 🎬 Complete Plex setup manually via web interface"
echo "3. 🔗 Investigate service interconnection API endpoints"
echo "4. 📡 Check RDT-Client container logs for startup issues"
echo ""

echo "🚀 DEPLOYMENT STATUS:"
echo "====================="
echo "✅ CORE FUNCTIONALITY: WORKING"
echo "✅ CRITICAL SERVICES: OPERATIONAL"
echo "⚠️  SOME AUTOMATIONS: NEED MANUAL SETUP"
echo ""
echo "The deployment is now FUNCTIONAL with manual Plex setup required!"
