# Storage Path Configuration Fix Summary
# =====================================

echo "üéâ STORAGE PATH CONFIGURATION FIXED!"
echo ""
echo "üìã SUMMARY OF CHANGES:"
echo "====================="

echo "1. ‚úÖ Fixed STORAGE_PATH in .env file:"
echo "   - Before: STORAGE_PATH=/home/adam/Desktop/Surge (WRONG - project directory)"
echo "   - After:  STORAGE_PATH=/mnt/mycloudpr4100/Surge (CORRECT - storage location)"
echo ""

echo "2. ‚úÖ Cleaned up misplaced service directories:"
echo "   - Removed service directories from project folder:"
echo "     ‚Ä¢ Bazarr/, Plex/, Radarr/, Sonarr/, Prowlarr/"
echo "     ‚Ä¢ RDT-Client/, Overseerr/, Tautulli/, Homepage/"
echo "     ‚Ä¢ GAPS/, Posterizarr/, NZBGet/, Cinesync/"
echo "     ‚Ä¢ media/, downloads/"
echo "   - Service data is now properly stored in: /mnt/mycloudpr4100/Surge"
echo ""

echo "3. ‚úÖ Updated .gitignore to prevent future issues:"
echo "   - Added all service directories to .gitignore"
echo "   - Service data will never be committed to Git again"
echo ""

echo "4. ‚úÖ Created storage path validation:"
echo "   - Added validate-storage-path.sh script"
echo "   - Integrated validation into deployment process"
echo "   - Prevents future storage path misconfigurations"
echo ""

echo "üîß WHAT THIS FIXES:"
echo "==================="
echo "‚Ä¢ Service data no longer stored in Git repository"
echo "‚Ä¢ STORAGE_PATH correctly points to dedicated storage location"
echo "‚Ä¢ Docker volumes now mount from correct storage path"
echo "‚Ä¢ Future deployments will validate configuration first"
echo "‚Ä¢ No risk of accidentally committing service data"
echo ""

echo "‚úÖ NEXT STEPS:"
echo "============="
echo "‚Ä¢ Storage path configuration is now correct"
echo "‚Ä¢ You can safely deploy services with: ./surge deploy plex"
echo "‚Ä¢ All service data will be stored in: /mnt/mycloudpr4100/Surge"
echo "‚Ä¢ Project directory stays clean and Git-ready"
echo ""

echo "üõ°Ô∏è  PREVENTION:"
echo "==============="
echo "‚Ä¢ Storage path validation runs before every deployment"
echo "‚Ä¢ .gitignore prevents service directories from being tracked"
echo "‚Ä¢ Manual validation available: ./scripts/validate-storage-path.sh"
echo ""

echo "üéØ CRITICAL ISSUE RESOLVED!"
echo "Your deployment will now use the correct storage location."
