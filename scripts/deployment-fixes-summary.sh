echo "üöÄ SURGE DEPLOYMENT FIXES - COMPREHENSIVE SUMMARY"
echo "=================================================="
echo ""

echo "üìã ISSUES IDENTIFIED AND FIXED:"
echo "==============================="
echo ""

echo "1. üîß STORAGE PATH MISCONFIGURATION"
echo "   Problem: STORAGE_PATH was set to project directory instead of dedicated storage"
echo "   Impact: Service data stored in Git repository, wrong volume mounts"
echo "   Solution:"
echo "     ‚úÖ Fixed STORAGE_PATH in .env to use /mnt/mycloudpr4100/Surge"
echo "     ‚úÖ Added service directories to .gitignore"
echo "     ‚úÖ Created validate-storage-path.sh for future prevention"
echo "     ‚úÖ Integrated validation into deploy.sh workflow"
echo ""

echo "2. üîë API KEY CONFIGURATION ERRORS"
echo "   Problem: Prowlarr applications missing prowlarrUrl field"
echo "   Impact: 'Prowlarr URL is invalid' errors, failed service interconnection"
echo "   Solution:"
echo "     ‚úÖ Fixed post-deploy-config.sh to include prowlarrUrl field"
echo "     ‚úÖ Updated both Radarr and Sonarr application configurations"
echo "     ‚úÖ Created test-prowlarr-apps.sh for validation"
echo ""

echo "3. üåê ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE EXPORT ISSUES"
echo "   Problem: Variables not properly exported, causing script failures"
echo "   Impact: Scripts receiving literal variable names instead of values"
echo "   Solution:"
echo "     ‚úÖ Fixed environment loading with set -a/+a pattern in post-deploy-config.sh"
echo "     ‚úÖ Proper variable export in all scripts"
echo ""

echo "4. üîó CONTAINER NETWORKING URLS"
echo "   Problem: Incorrect container URLs in service configurations"
echo "   Impact: Services unable to communicate with each other"
echo "   Solution:"
echo "     ‚úÖ Updated all container URLs to use surge- prefix (surge-radarr, surge-sonarr, etc.)"
echo "     ‚úÖ Fixed Docker Compose service naming consistency"
echo ""

echo "5. üìÅ PERMISSION AND DIRECTORY ISSUES"
echo "   Problem: Missing directories, incorrect permissions"
echo "   Impact: Services unable to write configs or access media"
echo "   Solution:"
echo "     ‚úÖ Enhanced directory creation in deploy.sh"
echo "     ‚úÖ Proper permission handling for all service directories"
echo ""

echo ""
echo "üõ†Ô∏è  SCRIPTS MODIFIED/CREATED:"
echo "=============================="
echo "üìù Modified Core Scripts:"
echo "  ‚Ä¢ scripts/deploy.sh - Added storage validation, improved directory creation"
echo "  ‚Ä¢ scripts/post-deploy-config.sh - Fixed API configuration, environment loading"
echo "  ‚Ä¢ .env - Corrected STORAGE_PATH configuration"
echo "  ‚Ä¢ .gitignore - Added service directories to prevent Git commits"
echo ""
echo "üìù New Utility Scripts:"
echo "  ‚Ä¢ scripts/validate-storage-path.sh - Prevents storage path misconfigurations"
echo "  ‚Ä¢ scripts/test-prowlarr-apps.sh - Validates Prowlarr application setup"
echo "  ‚Ä¢ scripts/quick-fix.sh - Emergency fix for common deployment issues"
echo "  ‚Ä¢ scripts/api-fix-summary.sh - Documents API configuration fixes"
echo ""

echo "‚úÖ DEPLOYMENT WORKFLOW IMPROVEMENTS:"
echo "===================================="
echo "1. Pre-deployment validation ensures correct configuration"
echo "2. Proper environment variable handling prevents script failures"  
echo "3. Storage path validation prevents service data in Git repository"
echo "4. API configuration includes all required fields for service communication"
echo "5. Error handling and logging improved throughout the pipeline"
echo ""

echo "üéØ RESULT:"
echo "=========="
echo "‚úÖ Storage path properly configured and validated"
echo "‚úÖ Service interconnection working (Prowlarr ‚Üî Radarr/Sonarr)"
echo "‚úÖ No more service data in Git repository"
echo "‚úÖ Environment variables properly exported"
echo "‚úÖ Container networking correctly configured"
echo "‚úÖ Robust error handling and validation"
echo ""

echo "üöÄ READY FOR PRODUCTION:"
echo "========================"
echo "‚Ä¢ All fixes integrated into main deployment pipeline"
echo "‚Ä¢ Future deployments will include all fixes automatically"
echo "‚Ä¢ Validation prevents common misconfigurations"
echo "‚Ä¢ Emergency fixes available via quick-fix.sh"
echo "‚Ä¢ Comprehensive testing and validation scripts included"
echo ""

echo "üìö NEXT DEPLOYMENT COMMAND:"
echo "============================"
echo "./surge deploy plex"
echo ""
echo "This will now work correctly with all fixes applied! üéâ"
