## üîÑ Updates & Automation

Surge includes powerful automation features:

### Automatic Updates
- **Watchtower** automatically updates all containers to the latest versions
- Updates check every 24 hours by default

3. **Kometa** - Updates metadata and creates collections

**Scheduled Processing:**
```bash
# Runs daily at 2 AM by default
./surge process schedule    # View current schedule
./surge process sequence    # Run manually anytime
./surge process logs        # View processing logs
```

**Manual Processing:**
```bash
./surge process run imagemaid    # Run individual services
./surge process run posterizarr
./surge process run kometa
```

### Shared Assets
All services share the same assets folder ensuring:
- ‚úÖ **Kometa** can access posters created by **Posterizarr**
- ‚úÖ **Media servers** display custom artwork
- ‚úÖ **ImageMaid** can clean up unused assets
- ‚úÖ No duplicate files or broken links

## üñ•Ô∏è Command-Line Tool Access

./surge exec cli-debrid --help     # Show available commands
./surge exec cli-debrid status     # Check debrid service status
./surge exec cli-debrid shell      # Interactive shell
```

### **Service Shell Access**
```bash
./surge exec radarr            # Access Radarr container
./surge exec plex              # Access Plex container
