```

### **Discord Notification Controls**

Surge provides granular control over Discord notifications. You can enable/disable specific types:

#### **Notification Types:**
- **🔄 Container Updates** - When new container versions are available
- **✅ Asset Processing** - When ImageMaid → Posterizarr → Kometa sequence completes
- **⚠️ Error Alerts** - Critical errors from any service
- **🎬 Media Events** - Playback events via Tautulli (play/stop/pause)

# Configure notification preferences interactively
./surge config notifications

# During setup (Auto mode enables updates/processing/errors by default)
./surge setup --auto

# During setup (Custom mode lets you choose each type)
./surge setup --custom
```

**Default Settings:**
- **Auto Install**: Enables updates, processing, and error notifications
- **Custom Install**: Lets you choose each notification type individually
- **Media Events**: Disabled by default (can be noisy)
- **System Status**: Disabled by default (low priority)

### **Discord Notifications**

When configured, Discord webhooks provide real-time notifications for:

- 🔄 **Container Updates Available**

## 🔄 Updates & Automation

Surge includes powerful automation features:

### Automatic Updates
- **Watchtower** automatically updates all containers to the latest versions
- Updates check every 24 hours by default
- Configurable update intervals and notifications

## 🔒 Security

Surge prioritizes security with multiple layers of protection:

### Security Features
- **Environment Variables**: All sensitive data stored in `.env` files
- **No Hardcoded Credentials**: All API keys and passwords use variable substitution
- **Secure Defaults**: Services run with non-root users when possible
- **Network Isolation**: Internal Docker networking with minimal port exposure
- **Git Security**: Comprehensive `.gitignore` prevents credential leaks

### Security Tools
```bash
# Run comprehensive security audit
./surge security-audit

# Check for exposed secrets
./surge troubleshoot

# Review service configurations
./surge status
```

### Security Best Practices
1. **Change default passwords** in your `.env` file
2. **Use strong, unique API keys** for all services
3. **Regularly update** containers with `./surge update`
4. **Monitor access logs** for suspicious activity
5. **Keep host system updated** and secured

> 📖 See `SECURITY.md` for detailed security guidelines and incident response procedures.

### Sequential Asset Processing
Surge automatically runs asset processing in the correct order:
1. **ImageMaid** - Cleans up and optimizes images first
2. **Posterizarr** - Manages custom posters and artwork
3. **Kometa** - Updates metadata and creates collections

**Scheduled Processing:**
```bash
# Runs daily at 2 AM by default
./surge process schedule    # View current schedule
./surge process sequence    # Run manually anytime
./surge process logs        # View processing logs
```

**Manual Processing:**
```bash
./surge process run imagemaid    # Run individual services
./surge process run posterizarr
./surge process run kometa
```

### Shared Assets
All services share the same assets folder ensuring:
- ✅ **Kometa** can access posters created by **Posterizarr**
- ✅ **Media servers** display custom artwork
- ✅ **ImageMaid** can clean up unused assets
- ✅ No duplicate files or broken links

## 🖥️ Command-Line Tool Access

Surge provides easy access to command-line tools:

```bash
```

### **Kometa (Metadata Manager)**
```bash
./surge exec kometa "--run"     # Run full metadata update
./surge exec kometa shell       # Interactive shell
```

### **cli_debrid (Debrid Management)**

**Web Interface**: Available at http://localhost:5000 (when enabled)

**CLI Commands**:
```bash
./surge exec cli-debrid --help     # Show available commands
./surge exec cli-debrid status     # Check debrid service status
./surge exec cli-debrid shell      # Interactive shell
```

### **Service Shell Access**
```bash
./surge exec radarr            # Access Radarr container
./surge exec plex              # Access Plex container
./surge exec decypharr         # Access Decypharr container
./surge exec services          # Show all available services
```

## 🔧 Updates

To update all containers:

```bash
./surge --update
```

To check for updates without applying them:

```bash
./surge --update --check
```
